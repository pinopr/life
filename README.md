# Life Philosophies
A documentation of philosophies of life that I've come to live by as per my experiences over the years

## Choose the path of least regret
You will encounter many instances in life where there is no good choice.
In these instances choose the path which would lead to the least amount of regret in the future.

Once you are at the future point where you have a certain amount of regret, always remember that the past you chose the path with the least amount of regret for the future you with the information at your disposal at the point of making the decision. So this is the least amount of regret you could have at this point in time.

### Inspiration
I've seen too many people consumed by regret as they get older.
So it seemed pretty obvious from early on that regret is important to manage so I don't accumulate too much of it over the years. Though that is easier said than done, but this philosophy helps.

### Examples
1. Choosing between jobs: if you are in this privileged position, choose the one you will regret taking least.

## Hope for the best but plan for the worst
The hope propels you forward and the planning. This is not a nihilist position, on the contrary it is about doing more to get to the best outcome.

### Inspiration
I don't really remember where I picked this up

## There is no shortcut to the top
There are many times during life where we think we can take a shortcut to "go up in the world".

During such times one should ask oneself if the idea is really a shortcut in the grand scheme of things with all consequences considered or if really does lead one to go up in the world. After all doing something wrong for a short term gain is going down.

### Inspiration
the first time I heard this quote was in the Naruto anime.
