# Life Philosophies
A documentation of philosophies of life that I've come to live by as per my experiences over the years

## Fools learn from their experiences, while the wise learn from history
Another version: fools learn from their own mistakes, while the wise learn from the mistakes of others

The responsibility of the inexperienced is to listen to the experience and try to salvage the nuggets of wisdom they can apply in their life.

You only have one life, use it wisely.

## Choose the path of least regret
You will encounter many instances in life where there is no good choice.
In these instances choose the path which would lead to the least amount of regret in the future.

Once you are at the future point where you have a certain amount of regret, always remember that the past you chose the path with the least amount of regret for the future you with the information at your disposal at the point of making the decision. So this is the least amount of regret you could have at this point in time.

### Inspiration
I've seen too many people consumed by regret as they get older.
So it seemed pretty obvious from early on that regret is important to manage so I don't accumulate too much of it over the years. Though that is easier said than done, but this philosophy helps.

### Examples
1. Choosing between jobs: if you are in this privileged position, choose the one you will regret taking least.

## Hope for the best but plan for the worst
The hope propels you forward and the planning ensures you're in the best position possible for any unforeseen occurrences. This is not a nihilist position, on the contrary it is about doing more to get to the best outcome.

### Inspiration
I don't really remember where I picked this up

## There is no shortcut to the top
There are many times during life where we think we can take a shortcut to "go up in the world".

During such times one should ask oneself if the idea is really a shortcut in the grand scheme of things with all consequences considered or if really does lead one to go up in the world. After all doing something wrong for a short term gain is going down.

### Inspiration
the first time I heard this quote was in the Naruto anime.

## Don't enable bad behaviour
By enabling people to behave badly you are reinforcing the idea that what they are doing is correct. To help them you have to break the reinforcement cycle.

### Inspiration
This is upon contemplation after watching "Welcome to the NHK"

### Examples

1. Going beyond your responsibility to do the work for your family instead of them stepping up and learning to do it for themselves.
