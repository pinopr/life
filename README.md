# Life Philosophies
A documentation of philosophies of life that I've come to live by as per my experiences over the years

## Fools learn from their experiences, while the wise learn from history
Another version: fools learn from their own mistakes, while the wise learn from the mistakes of others

The responsibility of the inexperienced is to listen to the experience and try to salvage the nuggets of wisdom they can apply in their life.

You only have one life, use it wisely.

## Choose the path of least regret
You will encounter many instances in life where there is no good choice.
In these instances choose the path which would lead to the least amount of regret in the future.

Once you are at the future point where you have a certain amount of regret, always remember that the past you chose the path with the least amount of regret for the future you with the information at your disposal at the point of making the decision. So this is the least amount of regret you could have at this point in time.

### Inspiration
I've seen too many people consumed by regret as they get older.
So it seemed pretty obvious from early on that regret is important to manage so I don't accumulate too much of it over the years. Though that is easier said than done, but this philosophy helps.

### Examples
1. Choosing between jobs: if you are in this privileged position, choose the one you will regret taking least.

## Hope for the best but plan for the worst
The hope propels you forward and the planning ensures you're in the best position possible for any unforeseen occurrences. This is not a nihilist position, on the contrary it is about doing more to get to the best outcome.

### Inspiration
I don't really remember where I picked this up

## There is no shortcut to the top
There are many times during life where we think we can take a shortcut to "go up in the world".

During such times one should ask oneself if the idea is really a shortcut in the grand scheme of things with all consequences considered or if really does lead one to go up in the world. After all doing something wrong for a short term gain is going down.

### Inspiration
the first time I heard this quote was in the Naruto anime.

## Don't enable bad behaviour
By enabling people to behave badly you are reinforcing the idea that what they are doing is correct. To help them you have to break the reinforcement cycle.

### Inspiration
This is upon contemplation after watching "Welcome to the NHK". In all honestly the moral of the story didn't immediately click for me and I read around a bit and thought about it a whole bunch before I realised how valuable and prevalent the applications of this philosophy is in real life.

### Examples

1. Going beyond your responsibility to do the work for your family instead of them stepping up and learning to do it for themselves.


## The only answer to fools is silence
Thankfully I learnt this one at a young age and avoided a lot of unnecessary conflict.

It's pretty simple, if you think someone is being an idiot then you don't need to respond, no need to have the last say, swallow your ego and avoid being a bigger idiot by staying silent.

It makes sense really. If you're dealing with an idiot chances are they'll do irrational things to hurt you. So the sooner you disengage the better.

### Inspiration
This is a famous Persian proverb:
> جواب ابلهان خاموشیست

### Examples
This really shouldn't need examples, since anyone you interact with will say foolish things at some point, your job is to recognise it, not get emotional, swallow your ego and stay silent.


## Nothing is worth going the extra mile
Wanting something really badly, stretching yourself to get it, putting in extra effort beyond your normal threshold... you get the idea. All of these are bound to result in disappointment in the future. Because no material thing in this world is ever worth it really when you sit down and think about it.

This isn't about working hard, or achieving life goals, this is more about valuing something beyond its worth and as a result bending over backwards to get it. So the real message here is to be mindful of the real value of things.

Perhaps this is not a good philosophy to follow when you're young as it may dampen your drive for excellence. But then again young people are more perceptible to putting too much value on things that are worthless.

The only exception I would consider to this rule is striving for the afterlife. Though
1. This may be a side effect of writing off this life.
2. This mentality also taints any optimism about the afterlife.

### Inspiration
After being disappointed in material achievements in life countless times this lesson comes naturally.

The 4th episode of the anime "Odd Taxi" does a good job of creating a visual story around this philosophy.

### Examples
1. Simping: there is nothing more disappointing in life than humans and relationships.
2. Getting at that newest pleasure (toy/gadget/game/accessory/etc.) is bound to become underwhelming once you've got your hands on it for a little while.


## Live life at your own pace
You will find many instances in life where it seems it's a competition and you must strive to become a winner. There might be many "logical" reasons for you to think this such as peer pressure, societal norms, family, colleagues, your ego, your connections and relationships. In these instances take a moment to reflect if it really is an existential crisis. What would happen if you didn't win that race? You might suffer some social discomfort but would that be more than the self inflicted suffering of struggling to live life at a pace that you're not comfortable? And all these people you're trying to save face in front of, are they really worth it? How many times do you have to become enemies with your best friends before you learn these bonds are fragile and worthless? Well maybe worthless is an exaggeration but it's about attributing the right value, and point being that we often over value. So save yourself a lot of headache in life by taking it at your own pace rather than the pace others would like you to live it. After all there's nothing worth rushing for at the end of it and it's more about the journey.

Sometime life demands that you live at a pace you're not comfortable with, such as times of hardship. You must recognise these too and strive to do your best with the hope they tomorrow will be easier.

But for the most part, difficulties in life are self inflicted.

### Inspiration
This is the direct or secondary theme in many anime, which explore this topic in different depths. I don't have a good one on the top of my head currently but if you search for it I'm sure you'll find some because it's pretty common.

Jungle book's "bare necessities"

### Examples
1. Rushing to finish a task, always thinking about the next task rather than focusing on the current one.
2. Becoming first in exams/competitions. Education is important and everything but so what if you don't become first? At the end of the day it's not the cause of a better life.
